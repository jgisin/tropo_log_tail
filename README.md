# Tropo Log Tailing
Tail your logs for Tropo's scripting API.

Simply type your Tropo username, followed by your Tropo password when prompted.

You can select full Tropo logging or a truncated version for quicker development. Currently, this program requires an active Tropo app, or you will receive a message saying "No new logs", indicating you have no active logs to trail. 

## Installation Instructions:
Download the tropo_tail.rb file.
Run: 
<pre><code>chmod 755 tropo_tail.rb</pre></code>

You can then run the program by typing:
<pre><code>./tropo_tail.rb</pre></code>
